## Comparing Q4 2020 to Q4 2019
The Carnegie Mellon Power Sector Carbon Index provides a comprehensive picture of the carbon intensity of electricity production in the during the previous 12 months and over an extended period to 2001. The CMU index also provides a summary of how much electricity generation is from coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables. According to the Carnegie Mellon Power Sector Carbon Index, U.S. power plant emissions averaged 813 lb CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was down 4 percent from the same time frame in 2019.

## Comparing performance in 2020 to 2005
The Power Sector Carbon Index for Q4 of 2020 was 38% lower than in the annual value in 2005, from 1,321 lb CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh to 813 lb CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh (or 599 to 369 g CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh). As of Q4 of 2020, the rolling annual average carbon intensity was 806 lb CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh (or 366 g CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh), which is 39% lower than the annual value in 2005. Total annual rolling CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were 1,481 million metric tonnes, which was 39% lower than in 2005.
