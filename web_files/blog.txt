## Comparing Q1 2022 to Q1 2021
The Carnegie Mellon Power Sector Carbon Index provides a comprehensive picture of the carbon intensity of electricity production in the during the previous 12 months and over an extended period to 2001. The CMU index also provides a summary of how much electricity generation is from coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables. According to the Carnegie Mellon Power Sector Carbon Index, U.S. power plant emissions averaged 794 lb CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh in the first quarter of 2022, which was down 5 percent from the same time frame in 2021.

## Comparing performance in 2022 to 2005
The Power Sector Carbon Index for Q1 of 2022 was 40% lower than in the annual value in 2005, from 1,321 lb CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh to 794 lb CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh (or 599 to 360 g CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh). As of Q1 of 2022, the rolling annual average carbon intensity was 828 lb CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh (or 376 g CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh), which is 37% lower than the annual value in 2005. Total annual rolling CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were 1,580 million metric tonnes, which was 35% lower than in 2005.
